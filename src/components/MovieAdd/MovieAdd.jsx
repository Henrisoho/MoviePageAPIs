// ### 1. Add Movie Form

// This should show:

// - an input field (for the movie title)
// - an input field (for the movie poster image URL))
// - a textarea (for the movie description)
// - a dropdown (for the genres)

// The Add Movie page should have the buttons:

// - `Cancel` button, which should bring the user to the Home/List Page
// - `Save` button, which should save these inputs in the database and bring the user to the Home/List Page (which now has the new movie)
